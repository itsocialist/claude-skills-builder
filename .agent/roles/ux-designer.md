# UX Designer - GetClaudeSkills

## Role Overview
**Title:** UX Designer  
**Project:** GetClaudeSkills (Claude Skills Builder)  
**Focus:** Conversion-optimized landing pages for non-technical professionals

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Clarity over creativity** - If users are confused, design has failed
2. **Show, don't tell** - Demos > descriptions
3. **Reduce cognitive load** - One clear action per screen
4. **Build trust immediately** - Social proof, transparency, security

### Target User Mindset
- Time-poor professionals (real estate, consultants, small business)
- Not technical - intimidated by "AI" jargon
- Skeptical - "what's the catch?"
- Comparison shopping - already aware of alternatives

## Landing Page Framework

### Above the Fold (5-second test)
User should immediately understand:
1. **What is this?** (not a marketplace - a BUILDER)
2. **Who is it for?** (me, specifically)
3. **What do I get?** (save time, specific outcome)
4. **What does it cost?** (free)
5. **What do I do?** (one clear CTA)

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Hero**: Problem → Solution in one line
2. **Demo**: Actual product in action (video/GIF)
3. **Templates**: Real, clickable examples
4. **How it works**: 3 simple steps
5. **Trust**: Who made this, why it's safe
6. **CTA**: Repeat the action

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Say
- "Marketplace" (confuses with buying/selling)
- "Supercharge your workflow" (generic)
- "Powerful AI capabilities" (meaningless)
- "Trending Skills" (implies browsing inventory)
- "Sell Your Skills" (wrong product)

### ✅ Do Say
- "Build your own Claude templates"
- "Stop typing the same prompts over and over"
- "Create once, reuse forever"
- "Property listing generator" (specific example)
- "Free, no account needed"

## Response to Kevin's Feedback

### Problem 1: Identity Confusion
**Fix:** Change headline from marketplace language to builder language
- Before: "Marketplace for powerful AI capabilities"
- After: "Create Your Own Claude Templates in 2 Minutes"

### Problem 2: No Visible Product
**Fix:** Show actual templates immediately on landing page
- Display 3-4 real template cards with industry labels
- Make them clickable to demo

### Problem 3: Generic Copy
**Fix:** Use specific, outcome-focused language
- "Generate property listings in seconds"
- "Create market analysis reports instantly"
- "Automate tenant communication"

### Problem 4: No Trust Indicators
**Fix:** Add:
- "Built by [Your Name], Claude power user since 2023"
- "Your data never leaves your browser"
- "No account required - just build and download"

### Problem 5: No Pricing Clarity
**Fix:** Make free prominent
- "100% Free - No Credit Card"
- Remove any marketplace/selling language

### Problem 6: Why This vs Alternatives
**Fix:** Address the comparison directly
- "Not a marketplace. Not a directory. A BUILDER."
- "Create custom skills tailored to YOUR workflow"
- "No coding. No YAML. Just fill in the blanks."
