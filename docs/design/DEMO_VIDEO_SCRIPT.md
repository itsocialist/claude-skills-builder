## Shot Breakdown

| Timecode | Visual | Voiceover / Text |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | **COLD OPEN**: A beautiful, formatted spreadsheet (Budget Tracker) zooms into frame. Charts, conditional formatting, cell formulas visible. | *(No voiceover, just subtle sound design)* |
| 0:03-0:06 | Camera slowly pans across the spreadsheet. "Q4 Marketing Budget" header, expense categories, totals auto-calculating. | "This spreadsheet just built itself." |
| 0:06-0:10 | A finger taps "Download" on screen. The `.xlsx` file appears in a macOS Downloads folder. User opens it in Excel. | "Fully editable. Real formulas. Yours in seconds." |
| 0:10-0:15 | Cut to: A PDF research report appearing. Then a Pitch Deck. Then a social media image set. Quick montage (1.5s each). | "Spreadsheets. Reports. Decks. Graphics." |
| 0:15-0:18 | Cut back to the GetClaudeSkills homepage. The "What do you want to make?" UI is visible. | "What will you make?" |
| 0:18-0:22 | A user types a single sentence prompt: "Create a Q4 marketing budget for a SaaS startup." Then clicks "Generate". | *(Sound of keyboard, then satisfying click)* |
| 0:22-0:25 | The same beautiful spreadsheet from 0:00 appears, completing the loop. | "That's it. That's the whole thing." |
| 0:25-0:30 | Logo + URL: **GetClaudeSkills.ai** + Tagline: "The output, not the effort." | *(Music sting)* |
