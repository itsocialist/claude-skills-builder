# Product Discovery: "Show the Cake" Strategy

**Status**: Discovery / Planning
**Owner**: Product/Marketing
**Date**: Dec 27, 2025

## The Core Concept
**Don't sell the tool (cooking). Sell the artifact the tool creates (the cake).**

Users often struggle to understand the abstract technical possibilities of Claude Skills (MCPs, execution environments, etc.). To bridge this gap, we must shift focus from "how it works" to "what you get".

## 1. Outcome-First Framing
*The principle that underpins everything else*

**The Problem**: Current descriptions are ingredient-focused (e.g., "Uses web search MCP").
**The Solution**: Frame by outcome (e.g., "Creates a 10-page competitive analysis").

### Execution
*   **Hero Images**: Show the OUTPUT (doc, spreadsheet, image), not the config.
*   **One-Liners**: Describe the deliverable, not the capability.
*   **Downloadable Samples**: real artifacts users can inspect.

## 2. Pre-Built "Power Bundles"
*Curated collections that demonstrate depth*

Instead of single tools, sell capability packages:

*   **Research Studio**: Web search + note-taking + bibliography. Output: Research brief.
*   **Content Engine**: Blog draft + SEO + image gen. Output: Publish-ready suite.
*   **Data Analyst**: Spreadsheet parsing + charts. Output: Executive dashboard.
*   **Project Kickstart**: Calendar + tasks. Output: Project plan.

## 3. The "Recipe" Model
*Making automation visible and editable*

Use a "When X, then Y" framing to make automation tangible.
*   **Visual**: Show steps lighting up in real-time.
*   **Product**: A simple flow editor (Trigger -> Step -> Output).

---

## 4. Visual Canvas Evolution (Sprint 15)
*The power-user interface*

The Visual Canvas should reinforce the "Cake" concept:
*   **Nodes**: Show previews of their output (e.g., a thumbnail of a generated report) rather than generic icons.
*   **Connections**: Visualize data flowing between steps.

---

## 5. Live Demos / Showcase Gallery
*Where the cake shines*

*   **Video Demos**: 30s clips focusing purely on the output appearing.
*   **Interactive Sandboxes**: "Try this skill" button that runs a pre-set prompt for a read-only result.
*   **Output Gallery**: A Dribbble-style feed of beautiful things created by skills.

## 6. Interactive Onboarding
*Immediate value creation*

**Flow**:
1.  Welcome -> "What do you want to make?" (Doc, Sheet, Image)
2.  Select Template (e.g., Budget Tracker)
3.  Click "Generate"
4.  **Result**: User downloads a real file immediately.

## 7. Natural Language Builder
*"Just tell me what you want"*

User describes: "I want a skill that takes meeting notes and emails a summary."
System shows: A preview of that exact email *before* the skill is even built.
