# 🚨 RELEASE DELAYED - December 29, 2025

**Date:** December 28, 2025 @ 11:59 PM PST  
**Decision:** Release postponed to December 29, 2025  
**Authority:** Brian Dawson (Product Owner)

---

## Summary

The planned Reddit launch for GetClaudeSkills has been **postponed by 24 hours** due to stability concerns and incomplete features discovered during production validation.

---

## Issues Found

### Critical
1. **Auth Confusion** - Previous auth changes required emergency fixes
2. **Deployment Process** - Agent pushed to production without approval

### Incomplete Features
1. **Admin Analytics** (`/app/admin/analytics`) - Uses hardcoded placeholder data
2. **Orphaned Routes** - Multiple features with no navigation ingress

### Documentation Gaps
1. Test credentials were undocumented
2. Route mapping didn't exist
3. Lessons learned not codified

---

## What Was Fixed Today

- ✅ Auth redirect logic (`/?login=true` → `/app?returnTo=...`)
- ✅ Library button styling (shared components)
- ✅ Bundles import error
- ✅ Deployment workflow with mandatory approval
- ✅ Created `docs/ROUTES.md` (complete route mapping)
- ✅ Created `docs/testing/TEST_CREDENTIALS.md`
- ✅ Created `.agent/workflows/lessons-learned.md`

---

## Action Items for Tomorrow

### Before Release
- [ ] Full production validation checklist
- [ ] All orphaned routes addressed (nav links added OR routes removed)
- [ ] Admin Analytics either removed or connected to real data
- [ ] Complete UI validation for Sprint 20 stories
- [ ] Marketing assets verified and ready

### Team Notifications
- [ ] Marketing team notified of delay
- [ ] Reddit launch posts rescheduled
- [ ] Any scheduled social media posts paused

---

## New Target Date

**Reddit Launch:** December 29, 2025 (TBD exact time)

---

## Lessons Learned

See full documentation: `.agent/workflows/lessons-learned.md`

Key takeaways:
1. Never push to production without explicit approval
2. Hardcoded data = incomplete feature
3. Document test credentials immediately
4. Validate comprehensively, not narrowly

**Status:** ⏸️ PAUSED - Resume December 29, 2025
