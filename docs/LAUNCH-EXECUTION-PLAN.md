## 📝 Reddit Post Drafts

### r/ClaudeAI Post (PRIMARY)

**Title Options** (pick one):
1. "I built a free skill builder so you can stop copy-pasting prompts into Claude"
2. "After typing the same prompts 100x, I built this: GetClaudeSkills"
3. "Show r/ClaudeAI: A visual builder for Claude Skills (free, no account needed)"

**Post Body**:

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI 👋

I kept finding myself copy-pasting the same prompts into Claude - property listings, meeting summaries, email drafts. Same structure, different details, every single time.

So I built **GetClaudeSkills** - a free tool that lets you create reusable Claude Skills in about 2 minutes.

**What it does:**
- Visual builder (no YAML/code needed)
- 10+ ready-to-use templates (real estate, consulting, content)
- Download instantly - upload to Claude and it just works
- A/B comparison to test different approaches

**Try it:** https://getclaudeskills.ai

No account needed, no credit card, completely free to use.

Would love your feedback - what templates would be most useful for your workflow?

*PS: This started as a weekend project and grew into something I actually use daily. Happy to answer any questions about the build!*

### r/SideProject Post (SECONDARY)

**Title**: "Weekend project that grew into my daily driver: a Claude Skills builder"

**Post Body**:

```
Started building this as a weekend project 2 months ago. Now I use it every day.

**The problem:** I was copy-pasting the same prompts into Claude constantly. Property listings, meeting notes, email drafts - same structure, different details.

**The solution:** A visual skill builder that creates reusable Claude Skills.

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth, DB, storage)
- Vercel deployment
- ReactFlow for visual canvas

**What I learned:**
1. "Show the cake" - users need to see outputs, not configs
2. Demo mode is crucial for conversion (no signup friction)
3. Templates > empty canvas for non-technical users

**Try it:** https://getclaudeskills.ai (free, no account needed)

What would you build differently?
