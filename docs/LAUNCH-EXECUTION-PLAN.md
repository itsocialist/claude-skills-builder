### r/ClaudeAI Post (PRIMARY) — Post Monday Dec 29, 6 AM PST

**Title**: "I've been using Claude daily for months. Skills changed everything - so I built this"

**Post Body**:

```
Been a Claude Pro subscriber for a while now - use it for code reviews, client proposals, all kinds of stuff. But I only found out about Skills recently and kind of kicked myself for not looking into them sooner.

Thing is, actually making Skills was a pain. The whole SKILL.md format felt like it was meant for developers, not regular users. I tried a few tools out there but nothing really clicked - either too complicated or didn't let me do what I actually wanted.

So I ended up building my own thing: GetClaudeSkills

Basically it's a visual builder where you can:
- Create skills without touching YAML/code (unless you want to)
- Start from templates instead of a blank page
- Compare two skill versions side by side before exporting
- Just download and drag into Claude

Made it free, no signup needed. Figured there's probably other people in the same boat.

Curious what templates would actually be useful for you guys? I've got a few up already (real estate, consulting, content stuff) but always looking to add more.

### r/SideProject Post

**Title**: "From Claude power user to builder: I made a Skills tool for non-developers"

**Post Body**:

```
Been using Claude Pro daily for a few months. Found out about Skills recently and immediately wanted to build a bunch of them. Problem was... actually creating them felt way harder than it needed to be.

Looked around for tools. Everything was either too technical or so dumbed down it couldn't do much. Nothing in between.

So I just built what I wanted: GetClaudeSkills

Stack if anyone's curious:
- Next.js 14, TypeScript
- Supabase for auth/DB
- ReactFlow for the visual editor
- Vercel

Main features:
- Visual skill builder, no code required
- 10 templates to start from
- A/B testing built in
- One-click export

It's free, no signup: https://getclaudeskills.ai

Biggest thing I learned building this: show people the output first, not the config. Completely changed how I designed the onboarding.

Anyway, curious what you'd do differently.

### r/Entrepreneur Post

**Title**: "I built a free tool to help small business owners use Claude AI more effectively"

**Post Body**:

```
Use Claude every day for proposals, emails, meeting notes - the usual. Noticed that most people I talk to (especially small business owners) don't even know about Skills, which is kind of a shame because they're incredibly useful.

Quick explainer: Skills let Claude remember your workflows. Instead of copy-pasting the same prompt every time, you just type "create proposal" and it does its thing.

Problem is, setting up Skills has a learning curve. You need to know the format, the structure, it's not exactly plug and play.

So I built GetClaudeSkills - basically a visual builder that lets you create Skills in a couple minutes without any technical knowledge.

Works for:
- Consultants who are sick of rewriting the same proposals
- Agents who need consistent listings
- Anyone who's copy-pasting the same prompts over and over

It's free, no account required: https://getclaudeskills.ai

If you've got a workflow you'd want templated, let me know - actively adding more based on what people ask for.
