### r/ClaudeAI Post (PRIMARY)

**Title Options** (pick one):
1. "Heavy Claude user here - just discovered Skills and built a tool to make them accessible"
2. "I've been using Claude daily for months. Skills changed everything - so I built this"
3. "The gap between Claude power users and everyone else is too big. I'm trying to fix that."

**Post Body**:

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI 👋

I've been a heavy Claude user for months - Pro subscriber, use it for everything from code reviews to client proposals. But I only recently discovered **Claude Skills** and honestly... game changer.

The problem? Creating Skills felt like it was designed for developers. I looked at some existing tools, but they either:
- Required too much technical knowledge
- Didn't focus on practical business use cases
- Weren't built for both quick templates AND power users who want full control

So I built **GetClaudeSkills** - a free skill builder that works for:
- 🏢 **Small business owners** who want templates they can customize
- ⚡ **Power users** who want a visual canvas to build complex workflows
- 🚀 **Everyone in between** who just wants to stop copy-pasting the same prompts

**What makes it different:**
- Visual builder (no YAML/code unless you want it)
- 10+ ready-to-use templates for real use cases
- A/B comparison to test variations side-by-side
- Download → Upload to Claude → Done

**Try it:** https://getclaudeskills.ai (free, no account needed)

Would genuinely love feedback from this community - what's missing? What templates would be most useful for your workflow?

### r/SideProject Post

**Title**: "From Claude power user to builder: I made a Skills tool for non-developers"

**Post Body**:

```
Hey r/SideProject!

I've been using Claude Pro daily for months. Recently discovered Skills and it felt like a superpower... but also like something only devs could really use.

I looked around for tools to help, but everything I found was either too technical or too basic. Nothing bridged the gap between "I just want a template" and "I want full control."

So I built **GetClaudeSkills**.

**The idea:** Make Claude Skills accessible to small business owners AND give power users a real visual builder.

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth, DB)
- ReactFlow for visual canvas
- Vercel deployment

**Key features:**
- No-code visual builder
- 10+ templates (real estate, consulting, content)
- A/B comparison mode
- Export to Claude in one click

**Try it:** https://getclaudeskills.ai (free, no signup needed)

Biggest lesson: "Show the cake" - users need to see outputs, not configs. Changed my whole approach.

What would you have done differently?

### r/Entrepreneur Post

**Title**: "I built a free tool to help small business owners use Claude AI more effectively"

**Post Body**:

```
Hey r/Entrepreneur 👋

Quick background: I'm a heavy Claude AI user - it's become essential for proposals, emails, meeting notes. But I noticed most people (especially small business owners) aren't getting the full value because they don't know about **Skills**.

Skills let Claude remember your workflows - so instead of copy-pasting the same prompts over and over, you just type "create proposal" and it knows exactly what to do.

**The problem:** Creating Skills requires technical knowledge most business owners don't have.

**My solution:** I built **GetClaudeSkills** - a free visual builder that lets anyone create Claude Skills in about 2 minutes.

**Who it's for:**
- Consultants tired of rewriting proposals
- Real estate agents who need consistent listings
- Anyone copy-pasting the same prompts daily

**What you get:**
- 10+ ready-to-use templates
- Visual builder (no coding)
- Download and upload to Claude instantly

**Try it:** https://getclaudeskills.ai

No account, no credit card, completely free.

Would love to hear what workflows you'd want templated - I'm actively building based on feedback.
