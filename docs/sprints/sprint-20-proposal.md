## Contact/Feedback Solution Options

| Option | Pros | Cons | Effort |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Custom Form** | Full control, no cost, data ownership | Build from scratch | 1-2 days |
| **Crisp** | Live chat, free tier, easy setup | External dependency | 2 hours |
| **Intercom** | Full support suite, AI assist | Expensive, overkill for MVP | 2 hours |
| **Tally Forms** | Beautiful, embeddable, free | Limited customization | 30 min |

**Recommendation**: Build custom contact form using existing Resend infrastructure. This provides:
- Data ownership (feedback stored in your DB)
