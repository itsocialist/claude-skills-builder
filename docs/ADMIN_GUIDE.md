## Configuration

### Required Admin Variables

Administrative access is controlled via environment variables. To grant admin privileges, add email addresses to the admin whitelist.

#### Environment Setup

```env
# Comma-separated list of admin email addresses
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,admin2@example.com

# Required for user invitations and backend management
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Platform Claude API key for onboarding skill preview (Sprint 18)
# This key is used to power the A/B comparison in the onboarding wizard
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_CLAUDE_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# Optional: Force specific feature flag states (emergency use only)
OVERRIDE_FEATURE_FLAGS={"feature_admin":"ADMIN_ONLY"}
```

#### Security Best Practices

- **Limit Admin Access:** Only add trusted team members to `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS`
- **Rotate Service Keys:** Change `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` quarterly
- **Use Environment-Specific Keys:** Never share production keys across environments
- **Audit Admin Actions:** Review admin activity logs monthly

> **⚠️ Warning:** The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses Row Level Security (RLS). Never expose this key in client-side code or public repositories.

## Feature Flags Management
*Introduced in Sprint 17*

GetClaudeSkills uses a dynamic feature flag system to control feature availability from the Admin Dashboard (`/app/admin/features`).

![Feature Flags Management Interface](./images/admin_features.png)

### Flag States

Each feature can be set to one of three states:

- **🟢 PUBLIC:** Feature is visible and accessible to ALL users (authenticated and anonymous)
  - **Use case:** Stable, production-ready features ready for general availability
  - **Example:** Skill Builder, Templates, Marketplace

- **🟡 ADMIN_ONLY:** Feature is visible ONLY to users listed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS`
  - **Use case:** Beta features, internal tools, or features under testing
  - **Example:** Admin Dashboard, User Management, Advanced Analytics
  - **Note:** Non-admin users will not see these features in navigation or be able to access routes

- **🔴 DISABLED:** Feature is completely locked and inaccessible to everyone
  - **Use case:** Features under development, deprecated features, or emergency shutdowns
  - **Behavior:** Attempts to access disabled features redirect to fallback routes
  - **Example:** Temporarily disabling a buggy feature during incident response

### Managing Flags

#### Via Admin Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `/app/admin/features`
2. Locate the feature you want to modify
3. Click the dropdown to select a new state
4. Changes take effect immediately (no restart required)

#### Via Database (Advanced)
1. Access Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to `site_settings` table
3. Edit the `feature_flags` JSONB column
4. Update the desired flag key (e.g., `{"feature_builder": "PUBLIC"}`)

### Emergency Override

If you accidentally lock yourself out (e.g., by disabling `feature_admin`), use the server-side environment variable override:

```env
# Force Admin Panel to be accessible (Vercel/Production)
OVERRIDE_FEATURE_FLAGS={"feature_admin":"ADMIN_ONLY"}
```

**Steps to recover:**
1. Add the override to your hosting environment (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
2. Redeploy or restart the application
3. Access `/app/admin/features` to restore proper flag states
4. Remove the override after recovery

> **💡 Best Practice:** Always test flag changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
